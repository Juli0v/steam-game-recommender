# Steam Game Recommender

Welcome to the **Steam Game Recommender** repository! This project features a recommender system for video games, accessible via a Streamlit interface. It includes:

- Data files
- A Python script to run the recommender
- A demo video showcasing the functionality

Game information and reviews have been scraped from Steam, with preprocessing done to ensure clean data inputs. This project is a collaboration between a friend and myself.

## Features

- **Recommendation System**: Suggests games based on user preferences and data analysis.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Intuitive web interface for users to interact with the recommender.
- **Preprocessed Data**: Optimized and cleaned datasets for faster recommendations.

## Data & Demo

Due to size constraints, the data files and demo video are hosted externally. You can find:

- **Data Files**: Necessary inputs for the recommender system.
- **Demo Video**: A walkthrough of the system in action.
